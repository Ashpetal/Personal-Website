  <h3>Hamsters</h3>
  <p>Bilbo and Gummy live in seperate cages. Bilbo lives in a small aquarium. Gummy lives in a large one. We are going to build them both new cages eventually. But for now they live in aquariums. They are both healthy and happy. </p>

  <h4>About</h4>
  <p> Bilbo and Gummy are both Syrians and my past hamster Layla was also a Syrian. I would like to get a dwarf hamster sometime so it gives me more experience for a website I'm building. It's all about hamsters and their care. Bilbo is the sweetest
    hamster I've ever met. He has never bitten me even when I just brought him home. Gummy is the complete opposite. He can be very nippy at times and has bitten us a lot. I trained him to not bite us but he does nibble if you smell like food. I got
    Bilbo for Christmas in 2018, and we got Gummy on June 1st, 2019.</p>
