  <h3>About me</h3>
  <p>I really like to code games on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">scratch.</a> I've made 3 virtual bunnies, and I'm making a virtual hamster. My dad writes codes too. I like to grow my own lettuce for my hamsters. I grow other things also. My
    family has
    beans, peas, and lemon trees. my mom waters them a lot and takes good care of them. I usually forget and they don't get water for a while if my mom isn't watering them. My favourite pop is Nestea and My favourite food is cheetos. My favourite
    colour is blue. I really want a rabbit and I'm talking to my parents about getting a dwarf hamster. I like to go outside when it's warm and take pictures. I don't take many pictures of people because I'm too shy to ask if I can take their
    picture. Usually my brothers would say no even if I asked. I like to write stories about animals. I'm writing one about a chipmunk named Pip and his two siblings, Fluffy and Stubby. The characters are based off real chipmunks that live at my
    grandmas house. They are very tame and let us pet them. We give them nuts to bring back to their burrow. If we don't have anymore nuts and he can still fit one in his pouch, he'll climb all over you looking for them. I love going to my grandmas
    house.</p>
